## Abstract

This project is going to use RNN to generate text base on different training data. 
The goal of the project is to configure out if we can tell the generated text have different writting style from related genre.
The training data is especially important cause the generated text will be based on the training data. 
I am planning use different fictions from different genre as training data.
ALthough the machine learning model will not produce meaningful text, I want to test if the computer will generate similar writting style. 

I am going to pass some non-english speaking international masterpiece and english speaking masterpiece into the RNN learning model. 
And check if I can tell the difference of each generated text.

I will use the same seed for the same training model and feed into different fiction genres to see how different will be the outcome.
The training model will be the same for each genre. however, if I have enough time, I will also try different training models.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
